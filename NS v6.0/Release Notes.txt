dsPIC (R) DSC Noise Suppression Library v6.0

Notes:

1. This is a major release as this library now supports the new dsPIC33E family of devices. 

2. There are no differences in the library functionality and API from the previous release. 
However, the library archive names have been renamed to clearly indicate which device
family it is intended for. Please refer to the dsPIC DSC Noise Suppression Library 
User's Guide on the library website for more details.
